Hi, I'm Brandon Azad. I'm a recent graduate of Stanford, having studied Computer Science with a
focus in Systems and Security. This blog is a collection of some of my security-related activities,
mostly focused on macOS and iOS.

Although I have a Twitter account, I don't currently use it for communication. If you'd like to
contact me, please email me directly or use an encrypted chat service like Wire or Signal.
